# This manual describes the API commands for recipes

### Authentication

    User should signup and signin with credentials (email, password). User will recieve a token for next API calls.
    
    Likewise, you can use the 401 - Unauthorized status code to indicate that a user could not authenticate.
    
### HTTP Status Code Meaning

**Successful**

    - `200 OK` - Everything worked as expected.
    - `201 Created` - The request was successful and a resource was created. This is typically a response from a `POST` request to create a resource, such as the recipe or upload image.
    - `204 No Content` - The request was successful but the response body is empty. This is typically a response from a `DELETE` request to delete a resource.

**Error**

    - `400 Bad Request` - A required parameter or the request is invalid.
    - `401 Unauthorized` - The authentication credentials are invalid.
    - `404 Not Found` - The requested resource doesnâ€™t exist.
